## 1. Product Goal / Problem to Solve

The primary goal of the product is to help users choose an appropriate board game to play.

The product replaces a previous version of a personal board game library that allowed users to browse games, view basic information, and filter by criteria, but lacked an easy and reliable way to add new games.

The core problem to solve is decision-making: given a set of available board games and a playing situation, help users quickly decide which game to play.
